  "guarantee": "'Â© Copyright  All rights reserved. \n  Upon request of the legislator, we inform you about our guarantee conditions, which do not affect the legal regulations. \n  Contents of the guarantee: The guarantee exclusively applies to work carried out by the company (limited liability) owned by Anna Likhnienko and Heorhii Shapovalov. For removed control units that are sent to us, the installation costs are not part of our guarantee and cannot be refunded. If the relevant control unit was installed at our premises for the customer, the guarantee also applies to removal and installation. Costs for inspections by third-party companies will not be reimbursed. The guarantee for exchange devices exclusively covers the components mentioned in the invoice. The guarantee is limited to the errors listed in our offer that apply to the customer's vehicle. The vehicle model, as well as the year of manufacture and device number, must be checked by the customer personally. (See product description on our website, on eBay, or on eBay Kleinanzeigen)\n  Duration of validity: The guarantee period starts from the invoice date and, depending on the service, lasts one year for unopened devices. The duration of the guarantee can be found in the product description. We do not repair control units or other components if they are not in their original condition or have been opened. However, at the explicit request of the customer, we can carry out a repair on the latter to the best of our knowledge. This requires the customer's consent. In such a case, we reserve the right not to grant or restrict the guarantee on the device, its installation, and proper functioning \n  Scope of application: Our guarantee service is generally valid in Germany and the EU \n  Guarantor: \n  Anna Likhnienko HIXA UG (limited liability)\n  GÃ¤rtnerstraÃŸe 17, 13055 Berlin \n  Guarantee case: The complaint must be made in writing or orally. In order to preliminarily assess whether this falls under a guarantee service, the respective component must be read out again by the customer and the error code must be transmitted to us along with a copy of the invoice. After approval for the examination of the guarantee case, the device can be sent to us, and the guarantee service can be utilized.'",
  "delivery": "1.The delivery of goods is carried out by shipping to the delivery address provided by the customer, unless otherwise agreed. \n  2.If the shipping company returns the shipped goods to the seller because delivery to the customer was not possible, the customer bears the costs of the unsuccessful shipment. This does not apply if the customer effectively exercises their right of withdrawal, if they are not responsible for the circumstances that led to the impossibility of delivery, or if they were temporarily prevented from accepting the offered service, unless the seller had announced the service a reasonable time in advance. \n   3.If the customer is acting as a business entity, the risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the sold goods passes to the customer as soon as the seller has delivered the item to the carrier, freight forwarder, or other person or institution designated to carry out the shipment. If the customer is a consumer, the risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the sold goods generally only passes to the customer or an authorized recipient upon handover of the goods. However, in deviation from this, the risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the sold goods also passes to the customer, even if they are consumers, as soon as the seller has delivered the item to the carrier, freight forwarder, or other person or institution designated to carry out the shipment, if the customer has instructed the carrier, freight forwarder, or other person or institution designated to carry out the shipment and the seller has not previously named this person or institution to the customer. \n  4. The seller reserves the right to withdraw from the contract in the event of incorrect or improper self-supply. This only applies if the non-delivery is not the fault of the seller and the seller has concluded a specific cover transaction with the supplier with due care. The seller will make every reasonable effort to obtain the goods. In the event of non-availability or only partial availability of the goods, the customer will be informed immediately, and the consideration will be refunded without delay. \n  5. Self-pickup is not possible for logistical reasons.",
  "payment": "1. The purchase price and prices for ancillary services are due for payment when the object of purchase is handed over and the invoice is handed over or sent.\n 2. The buyer can only offset against the seller's claims if the buyer's counterclaim is undisputed or there is a legally binding title. Excluded from this are counterclaims of the buyer from the same purchase contract. He can only assert a right of retention if it is based on claims from the same contractual relationship. \n 3. If the buyer does not pay the due purchase price and prices for ancillary services or does not do so in accordance with the contract, the seller can withdraw from the contract and/or, in the event of a culpable breach of duty by the buyer, demand damages instead of performance if he has unsuccessfully set the buyer a reasonable deadline for performance, unless the setting of a deadline is part of the delivery and shipping conditions. \n 4. All prices stated in our online shop include the statutory value added tax. \n  5. When ordering from Switzerland or other countries that charge import duties, please note that HIXA UG (limited liability) has no influence on the amount of customs duties or taxes to be paid in your country. In this case, please inform yourself about the costs incurred for an order, which are only charged when the goods are imported into your country. These fees are NOT charged by HIXA UG (limited liability) and are NOT already included in the shipping fees. The customer can choose between the following payment methods: invoice, immediate transfer, cash on delivery, PayPal or credit card."
